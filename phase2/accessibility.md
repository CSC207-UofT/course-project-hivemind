1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:
    
    a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or
    
    b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

- Equitable use
  - Sous-chef being designed for android devices was a deliberate choice, there are a lot more models of phones that are built in the android environment. Android phones are also considerably more affordable, thus our application is appealing even for users on a budget. The user's data is stored in App-specific dedicated internal storage, which is secure for all users from other potential malicious applications.

- Flexibility in use
  - The Android app could be used by both right and left-handed users. Accuracy of interactions are not strict as our buttons and interaction objects are large. There are no requirement of speed and pace when using the application, thus it is adaptable to all user paces. 

- Simple and intuitive use
  - The design and functionalities of Sous-chef is simple and straight forward. Users of all ages are able to interact with the application as many directions are given in terms of input. Simple language is used in all of our verbiage. Clear and concise notifications are provided to the user whenever an action is performed successfully or not. Navigation bar on the bottom has images, so it is easy for the user to find their way to the correct fragment. 

- Perceptible information
  - For the visually impaired, We implemented a sliding bar for font size changes to make important information on the application more legible. In addition, all of our string resources are stored in the strings.xml, which could be utilized by android's TalkBack accessibility program. Our app is fully supported by Android's dark theme, which will improve legibility for users in the dark or sensitive retinas.

- Tolerance for error
  - Our program warns users on the food expiry dates of their foods, this will eliminate risks for users as they will likely not consume rotten foods. In terms of design, we added a popup for deleting foods from inventory to prevent accidental deletion of inventory items, which will help eliminate accidental deletion.

- low physical effort
  - Sous-chef is fully capable of utilizing the user's system preference for dark/light mode, making it less physically demanding to read at night. Along with that, we have implemented a feature to dynamically change the font of our foods and recipes. The application is designed for a user on the phone, which they can use in any position of their preference. Very little repetition is needed in all implemented functionalities.

- Size and space for approach and use
  - Our program is built on the android OS, which adapts to any android devices of all screen sizes. We are able to provide the imperative information in a transparent manner to any users positioned reasonably. Seated and standing users are able to easily interact with the functionalities as user position is not required in using our program. Font size alteration can assist in the varying hand and grip sizes as the recipes and food lists become bigger and thus making it easier to interact with.  


2. Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

We would market our program towards young, casual and novice home-cooks. Many young people currently are too busy to buy groceries and cook for themselves, so they resort to take-out and delivery. These food options are more expensive and also less healthy. People striving to learn to cook but are too intimidated by the amount of recipes and their difficulties would look for an app like Sous-chef. We would provide them with simple dishes that they can immediately make with items in their kitchen.

3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.

Our program would most likely not be used by people that are a lot more financially capable, people that are not able-bodied, and people that are not willing to try cooking. In the first case, wealthy individuals are more likely to have access to healthier and prepared foods, thus they will have little to no use for an app that helps them cook. In the second case, people that are not able-bodied would have difficulty in cooking, thus making a majority of the functionality of our app obsolete. Lastly, people that are not willing to cook would most likely not install an app that is recipe focused.
